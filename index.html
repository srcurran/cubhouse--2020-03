					<h2>Our commitment to safety</h2>
					<p class="date">Last Updated March 20, 2020</p>
					<p>
						On March 19 Governor Newsom issued a statewide Stay at Home order
						to confront the growing coronavirus outbreak in California.
						Residents are ordered to stay at home except for essential needs
						and should practice social distancing in public. You can learn

					</p>
					<p>
						To help those in our community who use a bicycle as their primary
						mode of transportation, or for exercise, The Cub House is
						remaining open for essential bike service only. The safety of our
						employees and customers is, and will continue to be, our top
						priority as we navigate this uncertain time. In order to provide
						this service in a safe environment we have implemented strict new
						protocols for employees within the work space and for our
						interactions with customers. We ask that you review all the
						information on this website carefully and respect the plan that
						we’ve outlined.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any and all of this can change at any time. We will keep this
						space up-to-date with our current procedures and you can follow us
						on instagram
						<a

							href="https://www.instagram.com/itsnotabikeshop/"

						for updates.

					<h2>What to expect when you arrive</h2>
					<h3>Repair Drop-off and Pick-up</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You must have an appointment, we are not offering drop-in
							service at this time. Contact us via text/call
							<a target="_blank" href="tel:+16267553003">(626) 755-3003</a> or
							email
							<a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@cubhouse.cc"

							to set up a time.
						</li>
						<li>
							Show up on time for your appointment. If you are late, or fail
							to show, you must contact us to reschedule.
						</li>
						<li>
							When you arrive, wait outside the front gate. We will meet you
							there to discuss your repair while maintaining a minimum 6ft
							distance.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are dropping off a bike we ask that you place it in the
							stand provided and we’ll take it from there.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are picking up a bike we will place it back in the same
							stand outside the gate after you have paid.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Generally</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Appointments help us limit the number of people on-site,
							reducing the risk of exposure to our employees and customers.
							Make an appointment.
						</li>
						<li>
							At this time no customers are allowed to enter the front gate.
							If you require parts with your service we will bring out options
							to show you.
						</li>
						<li>
							Please, no cash payments. To limit contact we’d prefer you pay
							prior to pickup. We will email you an invoice to be paid online
							when your bike is ready, but if necessary we accept apple pay or
							credit card on-site.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our employees are regularly washing hands, wearing gloves and cleaning/disinfecting surfaces. We are limiting the number of staff and practicing social distancing on-site. 

						</li>
						<li>
							We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who does not
							abide by the safety precautions we’ve outlined here.
