					<h2>Our commitment to safety</h2>
					<p class="date">Last Updated March 20, 2020</p>
					<p>
						On March 19 Governor Newsom issued a statewide Stay at Home order to
						confront the growing coronavirus outbreak in California. Residents
						are ordered to stay at home except for essential needs and should
						practice social distancing in public. You can learn more
						<a target="_blank" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/">here</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						To help those in our community who use a bicycle as their primary
						mode of transportation, or for exercise, The Cub House is remaining
						open for essential bike service only. The safety of our employees
						and customers is, and will continue to be, our top priority as we
						navigate this uncertain time. In order to provide this service in a
						safe environment we have implemented strict new protocols for
						employees within the work space and for our interactions with
						customers. We ask that you review all the information on this
						website carefully and respect the plan that we’ve outlined.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any and all of this can change at any time. We will keep this space
						up-to-date with our current procedures and you can follow us on
						instagram
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsnotabikeshop/"
							>@itsnotabikeshop</a
						>
						for updates.
					</p>
					<h3 class="what-we-need">What we need from you:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Make an appointment.</li>
						<li>Don’t show up if you’re sick at all, in any way.</li>
						<li>Learn and respect the current operating procedures.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Our retail store is currently closed, but at this time we are still
						shipping online orders. All orders within the USA are shipped free
						of charge. Visit the online store at

					<h2>What to expect when you arrive</h2>
					<h3>Repair Drop-off and Pick-up</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You must have an appointment, we are not offering drop-in service
							at this time. Contact us via text/call
							<a target="_blank" href="tel:+16267553003">(626) 755-3003</a> or
							email
							<a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@cubhouse.cc"
								>info@cubhouse.cc</a
							>
							to set up a time.
						</li>
						<li>
							Show up on time for your appointment. If you are late, or fail to
							show, you must contact us to reschedule.
						</li>
						<li>
							When you arrive, wait outside the front gate. We will meet you
							there to discuss your repair while maintaining a minimum 6ft
							distance.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are dropping off a bike we ask that you place it in the
							stand provided and we’ll take it from there.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you are picking up a bike we will place it back in the same
							stand outside the gate after you have paid.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Generally</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Appointments help us limit the number of people on-site, reducing
							the risk of exposure to our employees and customers. Make an
							appointment.
						</li>
						<li>
							At this time no customers are allowed to enter the front gate. If
							you require parts with your service we will bring out options to
							show you.
						</li>
						<li>
							Please, no cash payments. To limit contact we’d prefer you pay
							prior to pickup. We will email you an invoice to be paid online
							when your bike is ready, but if necessary we accept apple pay or
							credit card on-site.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our employees are regularly washing hands, wearing gloves and
							cleaning/disinfecting surfaces. We are limiting the number of
							staff and practicing social distancing on-site.
						</li>
						<li>
							We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who does not
							abide by the safety precautions we’ve outlined here.
						</li>
